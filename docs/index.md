## Install

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/christopherkarani/Swarm.git", from: "0.5.1")
```

## Quick Start

```swift
import Swarm

@Tool("Looks up the current stock price")
struct PriceTool {
    @Parameter("Ticker symbol") var ticker: String
    func execute() async throws -> String { "182.50" }
}

let agent = try Agent(
    "Answer finance questions using real data.",
    configuration: .default.name("Analyst"),
    inferenceProvider: .anthropic(key: "sk-...")
) {
    PriceTool()
}

let result = try await agent.run("What is AAPL trading at?")
```

## Multi-Agent Workflow

```swift
let result = try await Workflow()
    .step(researchAgent)
    .step(writerAgent)
    .run("Write about Swift concurrency.")
```

| Execution model | **Typed `Workflow` graph** | Loop-based | Loop-based |
| Crash recovery | **Explicit checkpoints** | -- | Partial |
| Type-safe tools | **@Tool macro** | Decorators | Runtime |
| Streaming | **AsyncThrowingStream** | Callbacks | Callbacks |
