// MARK: - ParallelToolExecutor

/// Executes multiple tool calls in parallel using structured concurrency.
///
/// `ParallelToolExecutor` enables concurrent execution of independent tool calls
/// while preserving the order of results to match the input order. This is essential
/// for LLM workflows where multiple tools can be invoked simultaneously, but results
/// must be correlated back to their original requests.
///
/// ## Order Preservation
///
/// Results are always returned in the same order as the input tool calls,
/// regardless of which tools complete first. This is achieved by tracking
/// each task with an index and sorting results before returning.
///
/// ## Thread Safety
///
/// As an actor, `ParallelToolExecutor` provides thread-safe execution.
/// All tool calls are executed concurrently using Swift's structured
/// concurrency (`withThrowingTaskGroup`), ensuring proper cancellation
/// propagation and resource cleanup.
///
/// ## Error Handling
///
/// By default, individual tool failures are captured in the results without
/// throwing. Use the `errorStrategy` parameter to customize this behavior:
/// - `.failFast`: Throws on first error found in results
/// - `.collectErrors`: Throws composite error if any failures
/// - `.continueOnError`: Returns results with failures included
///
/// ## Example
///
/// ```swift
/// let executor = ParallelToolExecutor()
/// let calls = [
///     ToolCall(toolName: "weather", arguments: ["city": .string("NYC")]),
///     ToolCall(toolName: "stocks", arguments: ["symbol": .string("AAPL")]),
///     ToolCall(toolName: "news", arguments: ["topic": .string("tech")])
/// ]
///
/// let results = try await executor.executeInParallel(
///     calls,
///     using: registry,
///     agent: agent,
///     context: nil
/// )
///
/// // results[0] is weather (guaranteed, regardless of completion order)
/// // results[1] is stocks
/// // results[2] is news
///
/// for result in results {
///     if result.isSuccess {
///         print("\(result.toolName): \(result.value!)")
///     } else {
///         print("\(result.toolName) failed: \(result.error!)")
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Performance Considerations
///
/// - All tools are validated for existence before any execution begins
/// - Execution uses `ContinuousClock` for precise timing measurements
/// - Failed tools do not block successful ones from completing

    /// This method validates all tools exist in the registry before starting
    /// any execution, then runs all tools concurrently. Results are returned
    /// in the same order as the input calls, regardless of completion order.
    ///
    /// Individual tool failures are captured as `ToolExecutionResult.failure`
    /// entries rather than throwing. This allows the caller to handle partial
    /// successes appropriately.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - calls: Array of tool calls to execute concurrently.
    ///   - registry: Tool registry containing the tool implementations.
    ///   - agent: The agent making the tool calls.
    ///   - context: Optional execution context for agent state.
    /// - Returns: Array of results in the same order as input calls.
    /// - Throws: `AgentError.toolNotFound` if any tool doesn't exist in the registry.
    ///
    /// ## Validation
    ///
    /// All tools are validated for existence before any execution begins.
    /// This fail-fast approach prevents partial execution when a required
    /// tool is missing.
    ///
    /// ## Example
    ///
    /// ```swift
    /// let calls = [
    ///     ToolCall(toolName: "search", arguments: ["query": .string("Swift")]),
    ///     ToolCall(toolName: "calculate", arguments: ["expr": .string("2+2")])
